AlgoTrainer
🚀 Overview

AlgoTrainer is an interactive mobile learning app designed to make Data Structures, Algorithms, and Coding Patterns easy, visual, and intuitive. Built using React Native + Expo, it combines visual simulations, real-world analogies, and hands-on explanations to help learners truly understand DSA instead of memorizing it.

🎯 Purpose

Deep Understanding — Visualize how data structures behave internally

Learn by Seeing — Step-by-step animations for every operation

Beginner-Friendly — No prior coding knowledge required

Wide Coverage — From Arrays to Graphs, and Patterns like Sliding Window, Backtracking, and more.

🌟 Key Features
✅ Interactive Visualizations

Arrays

Linked Lists

Stacks

Queues

Trees

Graphs

HashMaps

Recursion

Algorithm Patterns (Sliding Window, 2 Pointers, Backtracking, etc.)

Each visualization comes with:

Step-by-step execution

Real-time animations

Explanations of what's happening under the hood

Time & space complexity breakdown

🧠 Learning Modules

Theory explanations

Real-world analogies

Code examples (JavaScript + TypeScript)

Scrollable detail views for each operation

Mini challenges coming soon

📱 Smooth UI & Navigation

Expo Router-based navigation

Stack + Drawer navigation setup

Clean theme system with light/dark support

Smooth page transitions & gestures.
