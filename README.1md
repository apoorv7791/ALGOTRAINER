# AlgoTrainer

## 🚀 Overview
AlgoTrainer is an educational mobile application designed to make learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) intuitive and engaging. Built with React Native and Expo, it provides an interactive platform for users to learn complex computer science concepts through visualizations, real-world analogies, and hands-on practice.

## 🎯 Purpose
- **Simplify Learning**: Break down complex DSA concepts into digestible, easy-to-understand lessons
- **Interactive Education**: Use visualizations and real-world examples to enhance understanding
- **Comprehensive Curriculum**: Cover fundamental to advanced topics in computer science
- **Accessible Learning**: Make computer science education available to everyone, regardless of their background
